The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript
In TypeScript, union and intersection types are powerful tools that help manage different types of data in a structured way. Union types allow a value to be one of several types, while intersection types combine multiple types into one.

Union Types are used when a variable can hold one of several types. For example, if a variable can be either a string or a number, you can define it as string | number. This provides flexibility in handling different types while maintaining type safety.

typescript
Copy code
function format(value: string | number) {
return value.toString();
}
Intersection Types combine multiple types into one. This is useful when you need an object to adhere to multiple interfaces. For instance, if you want an object to have properties from two interfaces, you can use intersection types to enforce that.

typescript
Copy code
interface A {
name: string;
}

interface B {
age: number;
}

type C = A & B;

const person: C = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };
Union types are great for handling multiple possible types, while intersection types are ideal for creating complex types by combining multiple smaller ones.
