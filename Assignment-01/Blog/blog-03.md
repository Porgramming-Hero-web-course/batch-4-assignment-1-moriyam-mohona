## Why Are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases

---

Type guards in TypeScript are essential for refining types during runtime. Without type guards, TypeScript can't always accurately infer types when the types are more complex or dynamic.

Type guards are particularly useful when working with union types or unknown types. They ensure that your code handles different types correctly and safely, preventing runtime errors.

Here are the main types of type guards:

typeof Type Guard: This is used to check primitive types like string, number, and boolean.

typescript
Copy code
function isString(value: string | number): boolean {
return typeof value === 'string';
}
instanceof Type Guard: This is used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class.

typescript
Copy code
class Dog {
bark() {
console.log("Woof!");
}
}

function isDog(animal: Dog | Cat): boolean {
return animal instanceof Dog;
}
User-defined Type Guards: These are custom functions that return a boolean and narrow down the type.

typescript
Copy code
function isCar(vehicle: Vehicle): vehicle is Car {
return (vehicle as Car).drive !== undefined;
}
Type guards are vital for ensuring type safety and handling dynamic types properly. They allow you to refine your type checks and handle edge cases effectively.
